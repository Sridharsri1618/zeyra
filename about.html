  <h3>Know Us</h3>
  <p>"Not just fashion. A feeling. A movement. A mindset. Welcome to Zeyra."</p>
</section>

    <div class="b">
  <h3>About Us – Zeyra</h3>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Zeyra</strong>, where style meets comfort and every thread tells a story. We are not just a clothing brand — we are a lifestyle movement built around the idea that fashion should not only make you look good but also make you feel confident, comfortable, and empowered. At Zeyra, we believe fashion is more than just clothes — it's a form of self-expression, an attitude, and a way of life.</p>

  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>The journey of Zeyra started with a simple idea: to create a brand that breaks the boundaries between modern fashion and everyday wear. We observed that many people had to choose between stylish clothing and comfortable outfits. So, we decided — <strong>why not both?</strong></p>
  <p>Founded by a group of passionate creators, designers, and entrepreneurs, Zeyra was born with a vision to revolutionize the fashion space with clothing that delivers both style and comfort. Our name, "Zeyra," symbolizes uniqueness, confidence, and strength — values that we hold close in everything we do.</p>
  <p>What began as a small dream is now becoming a growing name in the world of urban and casual fashion. From our first t-shirt to the latest collections, every piece we design represents who we are and what we stand for.</p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>Our mission is simple — to redefine modern fashion by creating high-quality, versatile, and affordable clothing for people who live with purpose and passion. We want to empower our customers to express themselves without limits. Whether you're in a business meeting, at college, at a party, or chilling with friends — Zeyra has you covered.</p>
  <p>We don’t just follow trends — we create them. We understand that the world is always changing, and so is fashion. That’s why we stay ahead of the curve, blending fresh trends with timeless designs to create outfits that suit every moment.</p>
  <p>At Zeyra, we care deeply about the details — from the feel of the fabric to the cut of the design. Everything is curated with intention, because we know that when you wear something that fits just right, it changes how you carry yourself.</p>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>We envision Zeyra as more than just a clothing brand. We aim to build a global community where people feel connected through shared values of creativity, self-expression, comfort, and authenticity.</p>
  <p>In the long run, Zeyra will not only offer fashion but will also expand into lifestyle products, accessories, and personal care — evolving into a full-fledged lifestyle brand. We also aim to adopt sustainable practices and create fashion that’s good for people and the planet.</p>

  <h3>What Makes Zeyra Different</h3>
  <p><strong>Style That Speaks:</strong> Our collections are crafted with originality and purpose. Every design is carefully created to make a statement — not too loud, but always unforgettable.</p>
  <p><strong>Comfort First:</strong> No more sacrificing comfort for fashion. Our clothes are made with breathable, premium-quality fabrics that feel just right.</p>
  <p><strong>Inclusive Fashion:</strong> Fashion belongs to everyone. At Zeyra, we believe in inclusive sizing, gender-neutral designs, and representing real people from all walks of life.</p>
  <p><strong>Affordable Luxury:</strong> We’re here to prove that looking great doesn’t have to break your wallet. We provide premium looks at fair prices.</p>
  <p><strong>Made With Love:</strong> From the sketches to the stitching, every Zeyra product is created with care, passion, and attention to detail.</p>

  <h3>Our Team</h3>
  <p>Zeyra is powered by a passionate team of designers, creators, marketers, and storytellers who love what they do. We come from diverse backgrounds but share a common vision — to make fashion better, smarter, and more expressive.</p>
  <p>We’re not a corporate giant — we’re a group of dreamers building something from the ground up, one design at a time. We listen to feedback, experiment with ideas, and always keep our customers at the heart of every decision.</p>

  <h3>Our Community</h3>
  <p>We don’t see our customers as just buyers — we see them as part of our Zeyra family. From the beginning, we’ve been supported by a strong community of people who believe in our mission and love our vibe. We interact with our community through social media, events, and exclusive launches.</p>
  <p>We love seeing you in our products. Your photos, your reels, your feedback — it inspires us every single day. When you wear Zeyra, you don’t just wear fashion — you wear confidence.</p>

  <h3>Join Us on the Journey</h3>
  <p>Zeyra is still young, and this is just the beginning. We have so many dreams to bring to life — new collections, exciting collaborations, creative campaigns, and more ways to connect with you.</p>
  <p>If you're someone who believes in staying real, dressing free, and living boldly — Zeyra is your vibe.</p>
  <p>Follow us on Instagram, join our mailing list, explore our latest drops, and be a part of the movement that’s reshaping modern fashion.</p>
  <p>Let’s grow together. Let’s create together. Let’s wear Zeyra — where fashion meets soul.</p>
